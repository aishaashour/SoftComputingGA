### Case Study: Electric Vehicle Charging Optimization

---

## 🚗 Problem to Solve
We have a set of **electric cars**, each requiring a certain **charging time**, and a limited number of **charging slots** available at the station.  
The goal is to **assign cars to charging slots and order them efficiently** to **minimize total waiting time** and **overall completion (charging) time**.

### **Given**
- \( n \): Number of electric cars, each with a charging time \( t_i \)  
- \( m \): Number of charging slots (where \( m < n \))

### **Find**
An assignment of cars to slots and their order on each slot that minimizes:
- **Total waiting time**
- **Total charging completion time (makespan)**

## ⚙️ Components of the Genetic Algorithm (GA)

### 🧩 **Encoding Technique**
- **Type:** Permutation-based integer encoding  
- **Gene:** Represents a single car  
- **Chromosome:** A permutation of all car IDs indicating the charging order  
  - Example: `[3, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6]`  
    - Slot 1 → 3 → 2 → 5  
    - Slot 2 → 1 → 4 → 6  

---

### 🌱 **Initialization Procedure**
Randomly generate several valid chromosomes:
1. Start with all car IDs `[1, 2, ..., n]`
2. Shuffle them randomly to create a valid schedule
3. Repeat to form the initial population of size **N**

---

### 🧠 **Evaluation Function (Fitness Function)**
The **fitness** of each chromosome is based on total charging time or total waiting time:

Fitness = 1/Total Charging Time
or equivalently,
Fitness = 1/Total Waiting Time

Higher fitness values correspond to more efficient charging schedules.

---

### 🎯 **Selection Method**
**Tournament Selection**:
- Randomly pick a subset of individuals (size \( k \))
- Select the best one (highest fitness) as a parent for reproduction

---

### 🔁 **Genetic Operators**
#### **Crossover (Reproduction)**
- **Method:** Order Crossover (OX)  
  Preserves relative order of genes and ensures valid permutations.

#### **Mutation**
- **Method:** Swap Mutation  
  Randomly selects two genes and swaps their positions to maintain diversity.
